## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We finished the main website features and had it deployed

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

We underestimated the work and time it would take to connect the client and server, as a consequence the website looks pretty bland design wise

### 3. What were some of the highlights or achievements that you are most proud of in this project?

We implemented auth using jwts and callbacks, no passport.js, clerk, or any of those simplifiers. We went in this project with an idea we had the faintest idea how to code and put together, but through trial and error we persisted and made a project which reflects most of our ideas and goals we had in mind for this project. It's always rewarding to put together something like this, there were times when the errors and bugs felt too great, even with the help of AI for some errors, there were some far too tricky for even them to see, it was a very rewarding experience to get the project working.

### 4. Reflecting on your web development journey so far, how have you grown since the beginning of the course?

Since the beginning of this course we knew some concepts about web development, and while some of us knew a bit more, we all learned a great deal of information putting this project together as a team, from to finish, this project has helped us realize both our strengths and weaknesses when it comes to web development, we've learned and shared ideas amongst each other and have grown as developers, the bridge between the start and end of building a full-stack web app is now that much clearer, and the fog that was once there has become thinner. Our skills and knowledge of web development concepts have improved since the beginning of the course.

### 5. Looking ahead, what are your goals related to web development, and what steps do you plan to take to achieve them?

For me (Pablo Valdes), I'd like to build more useful and complex projects, I want my skills to become good enough I can build just about anything I want or can think of; I believe our entire team feels that same way to an extent and this was a crucial stepping stone in that direction for each of us.
