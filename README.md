## About

Errorly is a programming question posting platform where users can interact with each other and posted problems.
These problems can be made by any user, and are meant to show users unique problems to practice.

### Description and Purpose

Ever practice Leetcode and Hackerrank thinking you're prepared to take technical assesments? Only to be asked unique questions you've never seen before?
This is a frustrating feeling and a result of not being prepared to answer truly original and unseen programming problems.

Errorly is a project aimed at having users post unique coding problems and challenges for other users to attempt them,
these problems are formatted in markdown and users in comments can talk about the question or post their own code solutions, but the
main point of the website is to have users try and make original coding problems which can be upvoted or downvoted by other users.


### Inspiration

Inspired by Leetcode, Stack Overflow, and all the coding problems that catch us off guard in technical assessments 💡

## Tech Stack

Frontend:

React, Redux, Typescript, TailwindCSS, Axios

Backend:

Node, Express, Postgres, Javascript, Passport
