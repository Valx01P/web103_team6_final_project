## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We were able to make a base structure for our project based on our wireframes, entity relational diagram, and project features. We were able to delegate issues and create reasonable milestones for the project.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Understanding how to create something from scratch is abstract and so to create our base project structure it took careful planning and trial and error to figure out a good structure.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

Organizing the project took a while, however we were able to complete the auth, which gives us a good start to make the rest of the project. We're prioritizing the completion of our planned tasks for the project by starting our backend tasks first, then our frontend tasks, and ultimately connecting the two together to get the app working.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

No features or user stories are at risk, although the implementation of how they work may change slightly, if we do need to change anything we will discuss it accordingly as a group and clarify changes or work on features depending on our best judgement, so if we see a better way of doing something, it's okay to go off the initial plan, especially since they were made without that information.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?
