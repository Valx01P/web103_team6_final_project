## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Our team met and actively communicated until we decided on a topic we could all agree on.
We were able to decide the main features we'd like to implement within our app and how we'd implement them.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

At first communication was a bit difficult, but we then learned the best way for us to communicate efficiently.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Any deadline extensions would be useful as it would allow our team during any potential busy weeks to take a little longer if we really need to.
